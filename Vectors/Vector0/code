Q. Vectors are used to group related signals using one name to make it more convenient to manipulate. 
For example, wire [7:0] w; declares an 8-bit vector named w that is functionally equivalent to having 8 separate wires.
Notice that the declaration of a vector places the dimensions before the name of the vector, which is unusual compared to C syntax. 
However, the part select has the dimensions after the vector name as you would expect.

wire [99:0] my_vector;      // Declare a 100-element vector
assign out = my_vector[10]; // Part-select one bit out of the vector

Build a circuit that has one 3-bit input, then outputs the same vector, and also splits it into three separate 1-bit outputs. 
Connect output o0 to the input vector's position 0, o1 to position 1, etc.
In a diagram, a tick mark with a number next to it indicates the width of the vector (or "bus"), rather than drawing a separate line for each bit in the vector.


module top_module ( 
    input p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f,
    output p1y,
    input p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    output p2y );
    wire q1, q2, q3, q4;
    assign q1 = p2a && p2b;
    assign q2 = p2c && p2d;
    assign q3 = p1a && p1b && p1c;
    assign q4 = p1d && p1e && p1f;
    assign p2y = q1 || q2;
    assign p1y = q3 || q4;
endmodule
